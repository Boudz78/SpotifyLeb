# Spotifyleb

Basically spotify, but cooler than spotify :)

## Prerequisites

You will need `node` installed.
You will need a package manager such as `npm` installed.

## Installation steps

- Clone your project using `git clone`
- Navigate to the project directory and run `npm i`
- Use `ng serve` to start the project
- Your application should be running at port `4200`, hence your url: `http://localhost:4200`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Final thoughts

This project took approximately 24-36 hours, and was definitely fun to develop. An important thing to notice that even in these simple projects theres always room to improve as i had a learned a few things such as the `RouteReuseStragey` which basically caches Components. As I thrive to dive deeper, as I discover the power of Angular.
